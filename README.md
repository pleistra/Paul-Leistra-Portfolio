# Paul Leistra, Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Paul! I'm a detail-oriented mathematician who has taught high school math for the past 20+ years. And now it is time for a new challenge as I look to begin a second career as a data analyst.

Teaching and data analytics have a lot of the same core skills. I know how to explain technical ideas to a non-technical audience and how to keep my audience engaged. I can read an audience and adapt on the fly, as necessary. I communicate clearly and collobarate effectively.

In terms of some hard skills, I'm taking courses in data analytics and data science (Google's Data Analytics certificate as well as a Data Science Certificate from the University of Waterloo). Through these courses and through some natural curiosity, I'm picking up skills in SQL, Python, R, Pandas, NumPy, Tableau, etc. I have a strong mathematical mind (I ranked in the top 200 of all math students in North America in the Putnam math contest in my undergraduate career).

I'm looking to secure an entry-level data analyst position for summer or fall of 2025. I know I have a lot to learn, and am looking to join a team where I can be mentored but also be expected to produce results.

The private high school in Ontario is growing. This has given us the opportunity to add new courses to our program.
This study will assist our school in deciding which courses to add.
